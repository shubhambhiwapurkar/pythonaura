# Project Tracking: Resuming Development

## 1. High-Level Overview of Project Architecture

The application is a microservices-based system migrated from a Node.js implementation. It consists of three core services:

*   **`app` (Main Backend):** A FastAPI application that serves as the primary API gateway. Its responsibilities include:
    *   User authentication and management.
    *   Handling database operations with MongoDB.
    *   Orchestrating calls to the other services.

*   **`astrology-service`:** A dedicated microservice for handling complex astrological calculations, such as:
    *   Generating birth charts.
    *   Calculating planetary positions.

*   **`daily-content-generator`:** An Azure Function responsible for generating personalized daily content for users. It integrates with Google's Generative AI to create this content.

The services are containerized using Docker, and the `docker-compose.yml` file defines a MongoDB container for local development.

## 2. Assessment of Current Development Status

Based on the file structure, the project appears to be in a partially completed state. The core structure for each service is in place, with defined models, API endpoints, and services. However, it's likely that the integration between the services is not yet complete. The presence of a `tests` directory indicates that some testing has been done, but the extent of the test coverage is unknown.

## 3. Proposed Roadmap for Resuming Development

The following roadmap outlines the necessary steps to bring the application to a functional state.

### Phase 1: Local Environment Setup and Service Verification

1.  **Database Initialization:**
    *   Ensure the MongoDB container is running correctly via `docker-compose up`.
    *   Run the `init_test_data.py` script to populate the database with initial data.

2.  **Service-by-Service Validation:**
    *   Start each service individually (`app`, `astrology-service`) and verify that they run without errors.
    *   Access the auto-generated API documentation (`/docs`) for each service to confirm that all endpoints are correctly registered.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation and Integration

1.  **User Authentication Flow:**
    *   Thoroughly test the user registration and login functionality.
    *   Verify that the JWT-based authentication is working as expected.

2.  **Astrology Service Integration:**
    *   Implement the client-side logic in the `app` service to communicate with the `astrology-service`.
    *   Ensure that the `app` service can successfully request and receive birth chart calculations.

3.  **Daily Content Generation:**
    *   Verify that the `daily-content-generator` Azure Function can be triggered.
    *   Confirm that the function can access user data and generate content using the AI service.

### Phase 3: Finalization and Deployment Preparation

1.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   Review and finalize all environment variables (`.env` files) for local development and production.

2.  **Deployment:**
    *   Follow the deployment instructions in the `README.md` to deploy the services to Azure.

## 4. Testing Strategy

All testing will be conducted in the production environment. No new tests should be written.
