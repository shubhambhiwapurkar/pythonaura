# Cosmotalks Azure Deployment Plan

## 1. Infrastructure Setup

*   **Resource Group:** Create a new resource group to organize all the resources required for the application.
*   **Container Registry:** Set up an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store the Docker images for the `app` and `astrology-service`.
*   **Database:** Provision a Cosmos DB for MongoDB API instance to serve as the application's database.
*   **Container Apps Environment:** Create an Azure Container Apps environment to host the containerized services.
*   **Container Apps:**
    *   Create a Container App for the `app` service.
    *   Create a Container App for the `astrology-service`.
*   **Function App:** Create a Function App to host the `daily-content-generator`.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

*   **GitHub Actions:**
    *   **Update existing workflow:** Modify the existing `python-deploy.yml` workflow.
    *   Build and push Docker images for `app` and `astrology-service` to ACR.
    *   Deploy `app` and `astrology-service` to Azure Container Apps.
    *   Create a new workflow to deploy the `daily-content-generator` to the Azure Function App.

## 3. Application Configuration

*   **Secrets Management:** Use Azure Key Vault to store and manage sensitive information like database connection strings and API keys.
*   **Environment Variables:** Configure the necessary environment variables for each service in the Container Apps and Function App.

## 4. Deployment Steps

1.  **Provision Infrastructure:** Use the Azure CLI or ARM templates to create all the necessary Azure resources.
2.  **Configure CI/CD:** Set up the GitHub Actions workflows to automate the build and deployment process.
3.  **Deploy Application:** Trigger the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to Azure.
4.  **Verify Deployment:** Test the application to ensure that all services are running correctly and can communicate with each other.
